# Countries App
Countries App is a web project where you can obtain information about countries around the world. You can filter countries by terms and perform searches, locate countries on a map, and find detailed information about countries.

## Live
You can experience Countries App live by clicking on this [link](https://the-countries-app-1.netlify.app/).

## Resources
I plan to use the REST Countries web API as a source of information.

You can check out this API from this [link](https://restcountries.com/).
